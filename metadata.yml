Title: ADMET properties prediction
Description: ADMET AI is a framework for carrying out fast batch predictions for
  ADMET properties. It is based on ensemble of five Chemprop-RDKit models and 
  has been trained on 41 tasks from the ADMET group in Therapeutics Data Commons
  (v0.4.1). Out of these 41 tasks, there are 31 classification tasks and 10 
  regression tasks. In addition to that output also contains 8 physicochemical 
  properties, namely, molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond acceptors, hydrogen 
  bond doners, Lipinskis Rule of 5, QED, stereo centers, and topological polar 
  surface area. eos7d58 contains an implementation of the model that also 
  produces the percentile based on DrugBank approved drugs.
