Title: ADMET properties prediction
Description: ADMET AI is a framework for carrying out fast batch predictions for ADMET
  properties. It is based on ensemble of five Chemprop-RDKit models and has been trained
  on 41 tasks from the ADMET group in Therapeutics Data Commons (v0.4.1). Out of these
  41 tasks, there are 31 classification tasks and 10 regression tasks. In addition
  to that output also contains 8 physicochemical properties, namely, molecular weight,
  logP, hydrogen bond acceptors, hydrogen bond doners, Lipinskis Rule of 5, QED, stereo
  centers, and topological polar surface area. eos7d58 contains an implementation
  of the model that also produces the percentile based on DrugBank approved drugs.
